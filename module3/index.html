    <!-- Element: Split Screen -->
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-7 paragraph">
        <p>As discussed in previous modules, the qubit in photonic computing is a photon, the smallest excitation of the electromagnetic field. In this module, we will learn how this photon can be manipulated to obtain different qubit operations.</p>
        <!-- Element: Subtitle -->
        <h2 class="subtitle">Quantum States of a Photon</h2>
        <p>Similar to other types of Qubits, photons can be represented as vectors indicating the state of a photon in the infinite state space.
Some examples of photon state representation are:
        <ol>
    <li>Photon Polarization</li>
    <li>Spatial Modes</li>
    <li>Time bins</li>
</ol></p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Polarization Qubit</h2>
                <p>Let’s look at one way of representing information in photons: polarization.
Classically, light is understood as a part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This can be visualized as a synchronous oscillation of electric and magnetic fields.</p>
      <p>Polarization of an electromagnetic field can be visualized as synchronous oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. These are always mutually perpendicular to each other. For example, in the image below, the E and B represent electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to the direction of propagation of light.</p>
      <p>We can represent polarization states as vectors similar to qubit states. For Qubits, we use states 0 and 1. For polarization, we can use states horizontal (H) and vertical (V).</p>
      <p>|Q⟩ = α |0⟩ + β |1⟩</p>
      <p>|P⟩ = α |H⟩ + β |V⟩</p>
      <p>Here  α and β are the probability amplitudes of measuring the photon in either of the polarizations. This method is called polarization encoding of Qubit.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Spatial Mode Qubit</h2>
                <p>Spatial mode of photons can be classically seen as the superposition of photons in different modes. For example, a spatial mode can be represented as:</p>
      <p>|Q⟩ = α |0⟩ + β |1⟩</p>
      <p>|S⟩ = α |0,1⟩ + β |1,0⟩</p>
      <p>Where |0,1⟩ and |1,0⟩ are two orthonormal spatial modes. It should be noted that both polarization and spatial mode represent the same photon only in different basis space. Spatial-mode qubits would not be very practical for transmitting quantum information since the phase between |0 and |1 is easily randomized by different environments acting on the different modes.</p>
      <p>In the figure provided, we can see the photons being split into two paths and combined using a beam splitter and mirrors. This device is commonly known as an interferometer and is a key concept in many quantum photonic circuits. The photon exists in a superposition of path a and path b.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Time bin Qubit</h2>
                <p>In this type of qubit encoding, the photons are considered to be in a superposition of mode of different time slots. These time slots can be seen as two different emission times or two different detection times of the photon.</p>
      <p>Thus, similar to other encodings, we assign a state to two different time-stamps in a system and a photon can be written as</p>
      <p>|T⟩ = α |0⟩ + β |1⟩</p>
      <p>Where the states 0 and 1 are specific time stamps where a photon detection is made. In the conceptual diagram here, we can see generation of time encoded photons as a “variable coupler” splits photons into two different paths with different lengths and the photons arrive at different times in the output.</p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Single Photonic Qubit gates</h2>
                <p>Photonic gates are operations of qubits which alter the state of superposition. This can cause a change in polarization or time delay or the phase(imaginary component) of a qubit. A gate in terms of hardware is a transformation of a system state. Some popular transformation components used in photonic computing are:
<ol>
    <li>Phase shifting</li>
    <li>Beam splitter</li>
    <li>Polarization rotation</li>
    <li>Polarizing beam splitter</li>
    <li>Interferometer</li>
</ol>These components can be used to build photonic gates such as CNOT, Hadamard, Rotation etc. We will look at what these components are, how they are built and what they achieve in the Bloch sphere. For recap, below is an image of the Bloch sphere and the state representation:
